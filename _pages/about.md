I am a PhD candidate at the University of Toronto working at the Learning Systems and Robotics Lab supervised by [Dr. Angela Schoellig](https://www.dynsyslab.org/prof-angela-schoellig/). I am interested in practical implementations of machine learning controllers for robots, specifically guaranteeing safety using safety filters. Additionally, I am passionate about open-source and enjoy working on open-source robotics projects such as the [safe-control-gym](https://github.com/utiasDSL/safe-control-gym).

Before joining the Learning Systems and Robotics Lab, I did my Bachelor of Applied Science in Engineering Science, majoring in Robotics at the University of Toronto. My undergraduate thesis was conducted under the supervision of [Dr. Goldie Nejat](https://www.mie.utoronto.ca/faculty_staff/nejat/) on multi-robot swarms for urban search and rescue. I also worked as a software engineer at Capital One.
